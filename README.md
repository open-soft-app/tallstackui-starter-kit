# Laravel + Unstyled Blade Starter Kit

It includes a built-in authentication system and provides unstyled views and layouts, allowing you to customize them as you wish.
You can install your favorite libraries and CSS frameworks, such as Bootstrap, Tailwind, NES.css, Alpine, etc., or choose not to use any framework at all and design everything from scratch.
